<b> About </b><br>

<p>
I am a fifth year PhD student in the department of mathematics at <a href="http://www.math.duke.edu">Duke University</a>. My supervisor is Professor Tarek Elgindi. Before this, I completed a master's in mathematics and bachelor's in mathematics and physics at the <a href="http://www.math.toronto.edu/cms">University of Toronto</a>. My master's summer project was supervised by Professor Fabio Pusateri. I am interested in analysis of PDE's and particularly problems related to fluids. More specifically, I have worked on singularity formation in incompressible fluids. I am currently on the job market for the 2026-2027 academic year.
